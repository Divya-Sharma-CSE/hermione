                <p>
                    Born to Muggle parents, she broke barriers and defied expectations. Whether by fighting for house-elf rights or 
                    battling dark forces, her courage was matched only by her compassion.
                    Her legacy is not just in the spells she mastered or the battles she fought, 
                    but in the heart, empathy, and strength she carried through it all.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="left">
                <p class="drop-cap">I<br>n a quiet Muggle town, far from Diagon Alley and dusty spellbooks,
                a brilliant young witch named <span class="h">Hermione Granger</span> was born.</p>
                <p>She had no idea she possessed magic until she received her letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                Unlike many first-years, <span class="h">Hermione</span> had already read most of her schoolbooks before arriving. She was ready — not just to fit in, but to excel.</p>

                <br><p>She was sorted into Gryffindor House, a choice that surprised some given her sharp intellect, which might have suited Ravenclaw.
                    But <span class="h">Hermione's</span> bravery, loyalty, and fierce sense of justice made her a perfect <span class="g">Gryffindor</span>.
                    She quickly became known as the top student in her class, though some saw her as a “know-it-all.”
                    Her friendship with <span class="h_r">Harry Potter</span> and <span class="h_r">Ron Weasly</span> began after they faced a troll together during their first year — and from that moment, the trio was inseparable.</p>

                <br><p>Throughout her years at Hogwarts, <span class="h">Hermione</span> played a vital role in many of the school’s greatest adventures.
                    She helped stop the theft of the Philosopher’s Stone, brewed Polyjuice Potion to uncover secrets in the Chamber of Secrets, and used a Time Turner to take double classes
                    — and save lives — in her third year. She stood up to injustice, once even punching <span class="gr">Draco Malfoy</span>, and founded S.P.E.W. to fight for house-elf rights,
                    proving that her sense of right and wrong ran deeper than spells and grades.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="right">
                <p>As <span class="v">Voldemort’s</span> return threw the wizarding world into darkness, <span class="h">Hermione</span> was at <span class="h_r">Harry's</span> side every step of the way. 
                    She helped form Dumbledore’s Army, taught students to defend themselves, and prepared for war. Before going on the run with <span class="h_r">Harry</span>= and <span class="h_r">Ron</span> to hunt Horcruxes,
                    she wiped her parents’ memories to keep them safe — a heartbreaking act of love.
                    Her magical skill, quick thinking, and unshakable loyalty helped the trio survive danger after danger.
                    She fought bravely in the Battle of Hogwarts and destroyed one of <span class="v">Voldemort’s</span> Horcruxes herself.</p>

                <br><p>After the war, <span class="h">Hermione</span> returned to Hogwarts to complete her education, then began working at the Ministry of Magic.
                    She started in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, improving rights for house-elves and centaurs, and later moved to Magical Law Enforcement.
                    She married <span class="h_r">Ron</span>, had two children — Rose and Hugo — and eventually rose to become the Minister for Magic, where she reformed corrupt systems and led the wizarding world into a brighter future.</p>       

                <br><br><p><span class="h">Hermione Granger</span> is more than just the brightest witch of her age — she is a symbol of courage, intelligence, compassion, and the belief that knowledge should always be used for good.
                    From her very first spell to her years as Minister, <span class="h">Hermione</span> showed us all that true magic lies not only in wands, but in wisdom, bravery, and kindness.</p>
