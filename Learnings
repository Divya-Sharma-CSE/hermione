This file contains questions I had while building this project, along with what I tried, and what I learned and useful tips. 

-----
- Use of `display: inline-block` on span content?<br/>
it’s the right choice for animating letters or words while keeping them aligned in a line.<br/><br/>

- ❓ How to make text appear in when scrolling down?<br/>
Too much JS- beyond my level of understanding right now<br/>
Animated text-Had to use vanilla JS--> notes made in register <br/><br/>

- ❓ How to get two borders? (preferably one shifted from the other)<br/>
Couldn't figure out two borders shifted with top and left offset<br/>
But learnt to use:<br/>
<dl>
    <dt type='square'> `border` </dt>
        <dd>border of the element </dd>
    <dt type='square'> `outline` </dt>
        <dd>the outside border, does not affect the doc by not taking any space, border-radius--> not applicable </dd>
    <dt type='square'> `outline-offset` </dt>
        <dd>space between the border and outline</dd>
</dl> <br/><br/>

- ❓Image in a round border?<br/>
create a div `<div class="img">` - set the width and height (equal) of the element contained in div (the size of the image u want in the page)<br/>
apply styles on the `<img>`- set `border-radius:50%`, border (DON'T FORGET TO SPECIFY SOLID), wdith and height as 100%, and `object-fit`. <br/><br/>

- Online sources suggested using linear gradient as a divider<br/>
`background: linear-gradient(to right, #d4af37, #5c4033, #d4af37);` set margin, height !!<br/><br/>

- ❓an arrow on gallery section to ask the user to hover over an element and see the effects?<br/>
just added another `div` for arrow, its text and the gallery images- to be able to space the two things, and make that `div` a  `flex` container.<br/><br/>
