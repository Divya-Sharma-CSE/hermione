This file contains questions I had while building this project, along with what I tried, and what I learned and useful tips. 

-----
- Use of `display: inline-block` on span content?<br/>
it’s the right choice for animating letters or words while keeping them aligned in a line.<br/><br/>

- ❓ How to make text appear in when scrolling down?<br/>
Too much JS- beyond my level of understanding right now<br/>
Animated text-Had to use vanilla JS--> notes made in register <br/><br/>

- ❓ How to get two borders? (preferably one shifted from the other)<br/>
Couldn't figure out two borders shifted with top and left offset<br/>
But learnt to use:<br/>
<dl>
    <dt type='square'> `border` </dt>
        <dd>border of the element </dd>
    <dt type='square'> `outline` </dt>
        <dd>the outside border, does not affect the doc by not taking any space, border-radius--> not applicable </dd>
    <dt type='square'> `outline-offset` </dt>
        <dd>space between the border and outline</dd>
</dl> <br/><br/>

- ❓Image in a round border?<br/>
create a div `<div class="img">` - set the width and height (equal) of the element contained in div (the size of the image u want in the page)<br/>
apply styles on the `<img>`- set `border-radius:50%`, border (DON'T FORGET TO SPECIFY SOLID), wdith and height as 100%, and `object-fit`. <br/><br/>

- Online sources suggested using linear gradient as a divider<br/>
`background: linear-gradient(to right, #d4af37, #5c4033, #d4af37);` set margin, height !!<br/><br/>

- ❓an arrow on gallery section to ask the user to hover over an element and see the effects?<br/>
just added another `div` for arrow, its text and the gallery images- to be able to space the two things, and make that `div` a  `flex` container.<br/><br/>

- ❓How to have a smooth scroll to different sections of webpage<br/>
In CSS type
``html { 
    scroll-behaviour:smooth;
}``

<br/><br/>

- ❓ How to do a flip animation?<br/>
!! Use `transform-style:preserve-3d` and `transition` on the main box/container which will rotate so that the content of the front side doesn't show up or glitch, and gets hidden on rotating completely.<br/>
There are two sides `.front` and `.back` - both of which need to undergo a transition of rotating <br/>
Use `backface-visibilty:hidden;` in the styling for both .front and .back
<br/><br/>

- on setting `grid-template-rows:repeat(3,1fr)` on .facts_content, i.e content1,2 and 3, i get a vertical columns with the facts and the corresponding heading as rows taking up the max-width.

- ❗❗ THE ALIGNMENT OF TEXT ON BACKSIDE OF FLIP CARD WAS GETTING MESSED UP<br/>
set the `position:absolute` of content of .front, .back <br/>
Then set `display:flex` and the desired alignment properties on the flipcard container(which contains both .front and .back)<br/><br/>

- Use `margin:auto` on grid container to horizontally center align the grid<br/><br/>

- ❗❗ Setting max-width on one of the items then aligning the parent container will not give the alignment as desired<br/><br/>
